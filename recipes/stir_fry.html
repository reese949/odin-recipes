    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <h3>For the stir-fry:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb (450g) chicken breast, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil (or sesame oil)</li>
        <li>1 bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, julienned or sliced into thin matchsticks</li>
        <li>1 small zucchini, sliced into half-moons</li>
        <li>1 cup broccoli florets</li>
        <li>1 small onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger, minced (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons green onions, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce (use low-sodium for a healthier version)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce (or hoisin sauce for a sweeter flavor)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar (or lime juice for a tangy kick)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey or brown sugar (optional, for sweetness)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons water (to thicken sauce)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chili flakes or sriracha (optional, for heat)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong>
            <p>In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, rice vinegar, honey (or sugar), sesame oil, chili flakes (if using), and cornstarch-water mixture. Set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Vegetables:</strong>
            <p>Slice the vegetables as noted in the ingredients list (bell pepper, carrot, zucchini, onion, broccoli) and set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong>
            <p>Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable or sesame oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the sliced chicken to the pan in a single layer. Let it cook undisturbed for 2-3 minutes until it starts to brown on one side. Then stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the center. Remove the chicken from the pan and set it aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Stir-Fry the Vegetables:</strong>
            <p>In the same pan, add another tablespoon of oil if needed. Add the garlic, ginger, and onion to the pan. Stir-fry for about 1 minute until fragrant. Add the remaining vegetables (carrot, bell pepper, zucchini, and broccoli) and stir-fry for 3-5 minutes, until they are tender-crisp. You can cover the pan briefly to steam the broccoli if needed.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Combine Chicken & Sauce:</strong>
            <p>Return the cooked chicken to the pan with the vegetables. Pour the sauce over the stir-fry and toss everything to combine. Cook for another 1-2 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken and coat the chicken and vegetables. If the sauce gets too thick, add a splash of water to loosen it up.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
            <p>Garnish with chopped green onions and serve over steamed rice or noodles. You can also sprinkle some sesame seeds on top for added texture.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Protein Options:</strong> You can swap the chicken for beef, shrimp, tofu, or even tempeh, depending on what you prefer.</li>
        <li><strong>Veggies:</strong> This stir-fry is very versatile. You can use other veggies like snap peas, mushrooms, baby corn, or bok choy.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat Level:</strong> Adjust the amount of chili flakes or sriracha to your spice tolerance.</li>
        <li><strong>Make it gluten-free:</strong> Use tamari or coconut aminos instead of soy sauce and ensure that your oyster sauce is gluten-free.</li>
    </ul>
