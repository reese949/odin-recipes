Add onion and cook, stirring often, until meat is browned and onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Season with taco seasoning and stir to coat the meat mixture.</p1>

        <br>
        <p1>Brush melted butter lightly to coat a 9x13 baking dish.  Arrange 5 tortillas along the edges and bottom of the pan, allowing any excess to hang over the sides and overlapping to completely cover the pan.  Spread shredded cheese over the tortillas. Top evenly first with cilantro and then tomatoes.  Spoon sour cream into a plastic bag and and squeeze over the tomatoes.</p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p1> <strong>Step 5</strong> </p1>
        <br>
        <p1>Arrange tostada shells over the sour cream overlapping them to make them fit. Spread nacho cheese sauce over tostadas.</p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p1> <strong>Step 6</strong> </p1>
        <br>
        <p1>Pour cooked beef mixture over cheese sauce and spread into an even layer.</p1>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p1> <strong>Step 8</strong> </p1>
        <br>
        <p1>Brush casserole with the remaining butter and press down any loose ends.</p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p1> <strong>Step 9</strong> </p1>
        <br>
        <p1>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and lightly toasted, about 30 minutes. </p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p1> <strong>Step 10</strong> </p1>
        <br>
        <p1>Let stand for 5 minutes and then carefully invert casserole onto a serving board or cutting board. </p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p1> <strong>Step 11</strong> </p1>
