        <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>

        <h3>1. Prepare the Meat Sauce:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook the Ground Beef:</strong> Heat a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Add the ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until it is browned and fully cooked, about 6-8 minutes. Drain any excess fat if necessary.</li>
            <li><strong>Sauté Onions and Garlic:</strong> Add the chopped onion to the skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes until softened. Add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds, stirring frequently to avoid burning.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Tomatoes and Seasoning:</strong> Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce (if using), dried basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and sugar (if using). Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and let it cook for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed, and add fresh parsley towards the end for extra flavor.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>2. Prepare the Cheese Mixture:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mix Ricotta, Egg, and Cheese:</strong> In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, shredded mozzarella (reserving some for topping), grated Parmesan, salt, and pepper. Stir everything together until smooth and well-mixed. This will be your creamy cheese layer.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>3. Cook the Lasagna Noodles:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Boil the Noodles:</strong> If you're using regular lasagna noodles (not no-boil), bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the noodles according to the package instructions, usually about 8-10 minutes, until al dente.</li>
            <li>Drain the noodles and lay them out flat on a clean kitchen towel or parchment paper to prevent them from sticking together.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>4. Assemble the Lasagna:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li><strong>Layer the Lasagna:</strong> In a 9x13 inch (23x33 cm) baking dish, start by spreading a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom. Add a layer of cooked lasagna noodles (about 3-4 noodles, depending on the size of your dish). Spread a third of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Add a layer of meat sauce over the cheese. Repeat the process: noodles, ricotta cheese, meat sauce. Continue layering until you've used up all the ingredients, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>5. Add the Toppings:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Top the Lasagna:</strong> Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese over the top of the lasagna.</li>
            <li><strong>Cover with Foil:</strong> Cover the baking dish loosely with aluminum foil. This helps the lasagna cook evenly and prevents the cheese from burning.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>6. Bake the Lasagna:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Bake Covered:</strong> Place the lasagna in the preheated oven and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Uncover and Bake Again:</strong> After 25 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>7. Rest and Serve:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cool and Set:</strong> After removing from the oven, let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes. This allows the layers to set and makes it easier to cut.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Slice the lasagna into squares and serve with fresh basil or parsley on top, if desired.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for the Best Lasagna</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Make Ahead:</strong> Lasagna can be made a day ahead. Just assemble it, cover with foil, and refrigerate. Bake it the next day for an additional 20-25 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Freeze for Later:</strong> You can freeze lasagna either before or after baking. If freezing before baking, cover tightly with foil and freeze for up to 3 months. Bake directly from the freezer (add about 25-30 minutes to the cooking time).</li>
            <li><strong>Meat Variations:</strong> You can use ground turkey, chicken, or even a meatless version with sautéed vegetables like zucchini, mushrooms, and spinach.</li>
